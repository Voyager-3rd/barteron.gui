The buyer pays the deal amount to the validator, and after the seller fulfills the agreed conditions, the validator transfers the payment to the seller. At the same time, the validator withholds a pre-defined commission as a percentage of the deal amount for their service. Payment is made in PKOIN cryptocurrency.\n\nIf the conditions of the deal are not met — for example, if the buyer does not receive the goods or services — the validator returns the payment to the buyer. In case of a dispute between the seller and the buyer, the validator evaluates both sides’ arguments and makes a decision regarding the deal.",

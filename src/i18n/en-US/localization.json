		"faq_answer1": "It is a deal involving an intermediary, who acts as a guarantor of the deal. The buyer pays the deal amount to the guarantor, and after the seller fulfills the agreed conditions, the guarantor transfers the payment to the seller. At the same time, the guarantor withholds a pre-defined commission as a percentage of the deal amount for their service. Payment is made in PKOIN cryptocurrency.\n\nIf the conditions of the deal are not met — for example, if the buyer does not receive the goods or services — the guarantor returns the payment to the buyer. In case of a dispute between the seller and the buyer, the guarantor evaluates both sides’ arguments and makes a decision regarding the deal.",
		"faq_question2": "Who pays the guarantor's fee?",
		"faq_answer2": "There are three possible options: \n • Buyer, \n • Seller, \n • In half (Buyer and Seller).\n\nThe first option will be selected automatically if the seller has not specified in an offer that he is willing to cover the payment. If desired, the seller can specify the second or third payment option when creating an offer. In that case, the option chosen by the seller — being more favorable for the buyer — will be applied automatically.",
		"faq_question3": "When a safe deal is possible?",
		"faq_answer3": "A safe deal is possible when purchasing directly from the seller (without using a pickup point).",
		"faq_question4": "How does a safe deal work?",
		"faq_answer4": "When placing your order, select the \"Safe Deal\" option. You’ll then be asked to choose a deal guarantor. After that, a chat will open with all participants of the deal, and you’ll see a link to the safe deal page. Follow the link and complete the steps as instructed.\n\nA new link is generated for each purchase. To return to an unfinished deal later, open the chat of the deal and click the link.",
